Quickstart Guide
================

Clone the repository
------------------------

The first step is to clone the repository

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/sschultz9/Network-Analyzer.git

Setup a virtual environment
------------------------------

.. note::
   
   This program was built in Python 3.13.5 and expects the user to install
   Python 3.13.5 to ensure compatibility. To build the environment, you
   must also have the python virtual environment module installed. Once you have 
   the venv module installed, run the commands listed below in your terminal.

1. Change directories to the root of the repository

.. code-block:: bash

   cd Network-Analyzer

2. Create a new python virtual environment to run the program in

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv venv

3. Activate the newly created virtual environment

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the required packages

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Execute the program
----------------------

1. Change directories to the src folder that contains main.py

.. code-block:: bash

   cd src

2. This is one example of how you could execute the program. Refer to this
   website's Usage page for further information pertaining to various 
   command-line flags that can be utilized

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo python3 main.py -i 192.168.1.0/24 -s SYN -m TCP -l 20 -t 1

.. note::

   If the above command does not work, you may have to replace python3 with the
   path to your virtual environment's python executable:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ../venv/bin/python3 main.py -i 192.168.1.0/24 -s SYN -m TCP -l 20 -t 1

The above command will do the following:

- Find the listening connections on the local machine, similar to netstat
- Perform a SYN port scan on each host in the specified network which is given in CIDR notation
- Perform a TCP traceroute to each host in the network with a maximum of 20 hops and timeout of 1 second
